This service operates through a mobile unit equipped with a laboratory for conducting medical tests and the capability to dispense medicines. The MMU employs an internet-connected device to collect and transmit medical data to the AMRIT application. It supports various medical standards and incorporates a feature that allows data capture and synchronization even when an internet connection is unavailable.
